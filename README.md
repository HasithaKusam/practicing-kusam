## Part 9: Favorite Code Snippet

This snippet demonstrates how to use **`Promise.all()`** in JavaScript.  
It allows you to run multiple asynchronous operations in parallel, and only continues once all of them have finished successfully.  
If any of the promises fail, the `catch` block will be triggered.  
This is useful for tasks like fetching multiple APIs or reading several files at once.

```javascript
Promise.all([ promise_1, promise_2 ]).then((values) => {
    // all input Promises resolved
    console.log("Resolved values:", values);
}).catch((reason) => {
    // one of input Promises rejected
    console.error("Promise rejected:", reason);
});
